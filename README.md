Bristol Data and AI Showcase - Smell exhibition

This repository contains code presented at the Jean Golding Exhibition: ["Bristol Data and AI Showcase"](https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2022/05/17/join-us-at-the-bristol-data-ai-showcase-2022/)

Below was the thinking behind the activity:

The idea for these activities is to have something that is engaging that demonstrates the point, that acts as a
shoehorn into both the more general idea I am trying to demonstrate, and ties into my research. The flow would
be something like this:

## Average Treatment Effect vs Individual Treatment effect
- For demonstration, what is something that is different for every person, where the **average** is beneficial/good, but for some people the outcome is **terrible**. This needs to be something that is:
	- Engaging
	- Simple to understand
	- Clearly demonstrates the point
	- Something people are happy to do

One idea might be something that *if you are able to do it*, is beneficial, but if you can't, isn't. For instance, 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32138119/172836153-9007c144-d576-4ee9-9964-09aa9414f61d.png)


Can use a visual aid like this to explain how not everyone benefits from treatment in the same way, but how statistics make us think that the average effect applies to the individual. 


Can give the example of an operation: *x*% chance of success. Makes it sound like sheer luck. But really this % chance is a combination of many factors:
- The ability of the surgeon 
- Your general health. The percentage survival may be based on your average 75 year old, who may have bad cardiovascular health, be overweight, and does little exercise. However you may be a keen allotment holder, who eats perfectly and runs every day. This would make your chances of survival much higher. You might also be treated by the world's top surgeon, who will have a much higher survival rate also. 

This is slightly tangential, but does demonstrate the difference between the average and the individual. 

### Activity
Some people like the taste of coriander, others hate it, it tastes soapy. 
Coriander lovers say it has a fresh citrus taste with a strong aroma, while the haters say it has a soapy taste and a pungent smell. 

This is a great example, as it ties in individuality, as well as both environmental and genetic components. 

#### Environmental
About 14–21% of people of East Asian, African, and Caucasian origin dislike coriander, while only 3–7% of people of South Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern origin dislike it. The environment or culture in which one grows up could be a reason for this, as an environment is known to have a significant effect on the number of cells that are able to identify each smell or taste.

#### Genetic
There is a genetic component to coriander taste perception. This perception is believed to be a result of an enzyme that changes the way one senses the taste of coriander—a genetic trait that is still being researched upon.

Several studies have been done throughout the world to find out the genetics behind the difference in taste perception of coriander leaves. Through these studies, scientists were able to point out the fact that most cilantro haters shared a particular group of olfactory receptor genes called _OR6A2_ that has the capacity to identify the smell of aldehyde chemicals that are present in coriander leaves as well as soaps.

It would be nice to have a taste or smell activity, but curious about the health and safety of this type of thing. Okay if bought/manufactured, but not okay if I've made it? 

### Foods that have genetic taste preferences:
- Orange juice
- Broccoli
- Cottage cheese
- Chicken
- Sweetened cereal
- Hamburger

### Smells that have genetic components:
- Malt
- Apple
- Blue cheese

#### Violet 
Newcomb and his colleagues found that the violet compound smelled “fragrant” and “floral” to those with a heightened sense, whereas less sensitive individuals described it as unpleasantly “sour” and “acidic.”



### More on environment and smell preferences
Pregnancy can cause hypersensitivity to the point of disgust, and some believe overwhelming odors can even explain morning sickness.

### Activity
- Can record how nice a smell or taste is throughout the day, and display the average. 
- Based on this average, we can say "okay, the average rating of this smell was *x*, and based on this, we will give *everyone* this meal"
- Clearly a problem with this, as some people find some smells and tastes not just "not very nice" but "disgusting" or unenjoyable. 
- Draw a parallel with treatment of medical conditions. Again, environmental and genetic components. Some people will respond well, some really well, some not at all, and some will be made worse off. 
- Narrow down to my problem of interest, with respect to the choice of antibiotics. Influenced by the individual, as well as what they are infected with. AND the genetics of the associated pathogen they are infected with. The pathogen may have genes for resistance, so the antibiotic might not work. The person may have sensitivity to the toxicity of the antibiotic if it's broad spectrum, so it might wipe out their good bacteria and give them a *C.dificil* infection. It might cause toxicity to their kidneys. BUT, most people will benefit, and that's the crucial point.
